            <h2>FIRST VISION</h2>
            <p>CHRISTIAN WIJAYA BEGAN HIS JOURNEY IN A MODEST GARAGE WITH ONLY DETERMINATION AND AN EYE FOR ELEGANCE. USING BORROWED TOOLS, HE CRAFTED HIS FIRST DESIGNS WITH UNCOMPROMISING STANDARDS. THIS HUMBLE BEGINNING EVOLVED INTO A GLOBAL LUXURY BRAND REDEFINING CRAFTSMANSHIP.</p>

            <h2>WANDERING AROUND</h2>
            <p>CHRISTIAN'S EARLY YEARS WERE DEDICATED TO TRAVEL THROUGHOUT ASIA AND EUROPE, IMMERSING IN DIVERSE CULTURES AND CRAFTSMANSHIP. THESE JOURNEYS EXPOSED HIM TO TECHNIQUES AND MATERIALS THAT WOULD BECOME BRAND SIGNATURES. FROM KYOTO TO FLORENCE, EACH DESTINATION SHAPED HIS VISION OF LUXURY.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>
            
            <h2>TOUGH TIMES</h2>
            <p>ADVERSITY SHAPED THE BRAND'S CHARACTER AS CHRISTIAN PERSEVERED THROUGH HARDSHIP AND REJECTION. WHEN FIRE DESTROYED HIS WORKSHOP IN 1976, HE REBUILT FROM ASHES. THESE CHALLENGES FORGED THE RESILIENCE THAT BECAME THE WIJAYA PHILOSOPHY: EXCELLENCE IS NEVER OPTIONAL.</p>

            <img src="assets/about-page/first product.jpeg" alt="First masterpiece">
            <h2>FIRST MASTER PIECE</h2>
            <p>THE PIVOTAL MOMENT CAME WITH THE CREATION OF THE "CELESTIAL" HANDBAG, COMBINING HAND-STITCHED LEATHER WITH REVOLUTIONARY DESIGN. THIS PIECE ESTABLISHED CHRISTIAN AS A VISIONARY WHO TRANSLATED ARTISTRY INTO FUNCTIONAL LUXURY. THE CELESTIAL REMAINS IN PRODUCTION TODAY—A TESTAMENT TO TIMELESS INNOVATION.</p>

            <img src="assets/about-page/toko lama2.jpg" alt="First boutique">
            <h2>FIRST BOUTIQUE</h2>
            <p>THE FIRST CHRISTIAN WIJAYA BOUTIQUE OPENED IN AN ELEGANT TOWNHOUSE, DESIGNED LIKE A PRIVATE RESIDENCE RATHER THAN RETAIL SPACE. IT FEATURED HAND-SELECTED FURNISHINGS, CUSTOM LIGHTING, AND DISCREET AREAS FOR BESPOKE CONSULTATIONS. THIS APPROACH BECAME THE TEMPLATE FOR ALL FUTURE LOCATIONS.</p>

            <h2>EARLY FAME</h2>
            <p>RECOGNITION CAME AS CULTURAL ICONS EMBRACED THE BRAND, INCLUDING AKIRA KUROSAWA AND ANNA PAVLOVA. CHRISTIAN MAINTAINED HIS FOCUS ON CRAFTSMANSHIP RATHER THAN CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS. THIS AUTHENTICITY RESONATED WITH CLIENTS WHO VALUED SUBSTANCE OVER SPECTACLE.</p>

            <h1 class="year">1988</h1>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h2>GLOBAL RECOGNITION</h2>
            <p>INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION EXPLODED AFTER AN EXHIBITION AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, WHERE CHRISTIAN'S WORK WAS CELEBRATED AS FUNCTIONAL ART. DESPITE FASHION HOUSES SEEKING COLLABORATIONS, CHRISTIAN MAINTAINED STRICT STANDARDS. THIS PHILOSOPHY ENSURED EACH WIJAYA CREATION REMAINED EXCEPTIONAL.</p>

        <div class="history fade-in-up">
            <h1 class="year">1989-1995</h1>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h2>COPYRIGHT ISSUES</h2>
            <p>AS THE BRAND GREW, THE DISTINCTIVE WIJAYA AESTHETIC BECAME TARGET OF COUNTERFEITS. CHRISTIAN RESPONDED BY DEVELOPING PROPRIETARY TECHNIQUES THAT COULDN'T BE EASILY REPLICATED. THE HOUSE ESTABLISHED AN AUTHENTICATION DEPARTMENT THAT PIONEERED VERIFICATION METHODS WHILE EDUCATING CLIENTS ABOUT AUTHENTICITY.</p>

            <h1 class="year">1995-1997</h1>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h2>ECONOMIC TURMOIL</h2>
            <p>THE ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS TESTED THE BRAND AS LUXURY MARKETS CONTRACTED. CHRISTIAN CHOSE TO SCALE BACK PRODUCTION RATHER THAN COMPROMISE QUALITY. THIS PERIOD INSPIRED THE "ESSENTIAL" COLLECTION—FOCUSING ON EXCEPTIONAL MATERIALS WHILE ELIMINATING EXTRANEOUS ELEMENTS.</p>
            
            <div class="separator"></div>
            
            <h2>NEAR BANKRUPTCY</h2>
            <p>FACING DEBTS, THE COMPANY NEARED FINANCIAL COLLAPSE WITH INVESTORS PRESSURING CHRISTIAN TO SELL HIS RIGHTS. HE REFUSED, LIQUIDATING PERSONAL ASSETS TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE. THIS COMMITMENT EARNED LOYALTY FROM EMPLOYEES AND CLIENTS WHO PLACED ADVANCE ORDERS TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS.</p>

            <h2>RISE OF WIJAYA</h2>
            <p>EMERGING FROM ADVERSITY, WIJAYA ENTERED A RENAISSANCE MARKED BY BOLD DIRECTION AND STRATEGIC EXPANSION. ARCHITECT TADAO ENDO DESIGNED FLAGSHIP STORES WITH CONCEPTS HARMONIZING WITH THE BRAND'S AESTHETICS. THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED COMMITMENTS TO PRESERVING CRAFTSMANSHIP THROUGH APPRENTICESHIPS AND CONSERVATION.</p>
